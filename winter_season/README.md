# Winter Season
## Assignment
As always, farmers are afraid of a harsh winter, because too many snowy days can ruin the crops for the whole year to come. More precisely, if out of  days it is snowing on at least  days, the season is considered to be a disaster.

You know that the probability of snow on the th day is , independently of other days. Compute the probability of a disaster season!

Input
The first line of the input contains the number  of test cases. Each of the  test cases is described as follows:

It starts with a line that contains two integers , separated by a space, where  denotes the number of days the winter will last ), and the season will be a disaster if the number of snowy days is at least  ().
The following line defines the probabilities of snow on each of the  days. It contains  real numbers , separated by a space, denoting that the probability of a heavy snow on the th day is  (, for all ).
Output
For each test case output one line containing one real number denoting the probability of the season to be a disaster. Your solution is going to be accepted if it has an absolute or relative error of at most .

Points
There are two test sets, worth  points in total.

For the first test set, worth  point, you may assume that .
For the second test set, worth  point, there are no additional assumptions.
