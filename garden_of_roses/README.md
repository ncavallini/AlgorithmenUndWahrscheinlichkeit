# Garden of Roses
## Assignment
You are very proud of your beautiful garden of colourful roses. However, recently you noticed that weed has started growing in the garden enclosed by the roses. You want to get rid of it, but in order to do so you need to first know whether each weed is inside of your rose garden or not.

## Input
* The first line of the input file contains a number `t <= 30` of test cases. Each of the `t` test cases is described as follows.
* It starts with a line which consists of two integers `n m`, separated by a space, denoting the number of roses in your garden (`3 <= n <= 100`) and the number of weeds (`1 <= m <= 50`).
* The following  `n` lines describe the roses. The `i`-th line consists of two integers `x y`, separated by a space, denoting the position of the `i`-th rose (`-100 <= x,y <= 100`). It is guaranteed that no three roses lie on the same line and that no two roses are at the same position.
* The following `m` lines describe the weeds. The `i`-th line consists of two integers `x y`, separated by a space, denoting the position of the `i`-th weed (`-100 <= x,y <= 100`).

## Output
For each test case output a single string of length `m` consisting of characters `'y'` and `'n'` such that the  `i`-th character of the string is `'y'` if the `i`-th weed is inside the region enclosed by the roses, and `'n'`, otherwise, for all `i = 1, ..., m`.

## Points
This exercise is worth 100 points.
